#   Actually I will try to place a pointer to the chlorophyll notebook here
# jupyter-earth has a sub-folder called `docs` with a _toc.yml file that has two entries: 
# - file: index
# - file: tools
# 
# The corresponding files are in the same folder: index.md and tools.md. Both are a few lines of markdown.

- file: chlorophyll
